'gpxrte' is Open Source software and licensed under the `GNU General
Public License version 3 or later`. You are welcome to change and

### Purpose

'gpxrte' is a command line tool written in Python to manage the RTE
segments of GPX files. The WPT and TRK segments are ignored.

The provided functions facilitate the route planning for a GARMIN
Oregon 450 and the navigation system used in a Mercedes car. Though
both using GPX for guidance they do not understand what was recorded
by the other. The original format conversion routines where soon
followed by general purpose services then.


### Caution

I can only guarantee that 'gpxrte' works with my own equipment because
I do not have the financial power to own more than one Oregon 450 and
and more than one Mercedes to generalize my experiments.

'gpxrte' is based on unoffical reengineering results without official
documentation. Though reengineering is a little bit exaggerated in
this case I do not know the iural impacts on your warranty etc.

For the GARMIN you should not save the resulting files in its internal
memory but on the sim card to be removed if the device refuses to boot
(because of an contol character etc in a GPX file). Otherwise you
might end up with a brick stone! Though it is an interesting
experience to unbrick!


### Getting started:

After installation type the following on the command line of a
terminal and you should get:

$ gpxrte -h
usage: gpxrte.py [-h] [-v]
                 
                 {show,name,pull,push,purge,flat,reverse,head,tail,swap,find,daimler}
                 ...
